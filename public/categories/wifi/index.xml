      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; I made a device that logs all the wifi traffic and physically maps it out. It can also do some hacking stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Intro &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#intro&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted to make something. I love making stuff. Making a physical thing would be awesome, something that was small and discrete, something that would make me feel like a spy hiding in plain sight. At the time of this spell of inspiration, I was learning about wifi and its capabilities at uni. I combined these ideas together to make a device that can log and and map any device that is using wifi. This means that I can track any phone or laptop even if it is not connected to wifi, the wifi just needs to be turned on on the device. The making of this project can be broken up into four parts. &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Create the physical device that is&#xA;capable of searching for wifi devices and capturing network traffic while also knowing its physical location &lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Create a script that will allow the device to log information about wifi devices acompanied by information about its physical location. &lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Create a simple user interface to plot the information recorded by the device. &lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Add some hacking features to feel cool. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
