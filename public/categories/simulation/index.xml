      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a story about one time when I was and I stumbled upon a new domain of interest. This interest was related to gambling and it occured when a friend of mine told me of a “foolproof” betting strategy for the game of roulette.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gambling-strategy&#34; class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;The gambling strategy &lt;span class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34; style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#the-gambling-strategy&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any games where there is a near 50% chance of winning and where winning doubles your money and losing loses all your money you do this: First bet $1, if you lose this bet instead of betting $1, on the next turn you bet $2 (double the previous bet), if you lose again, bet $4, then $8 etc. If you win however, you restart the betting number and bet $1 again.&#xA;So the tactic is basically double-down each time you lose. In the above scenario, if you lose the first bet, you are down $1, if you lose the second bet you are then down $3 ($2 + $1), if you lose the next bet you are down $7 ($4 + $2 + $1) etc. Whenever you win, assuming you eventually win, you will be net positive. For example if you were down $3 and you then bet $4, you would then be up $1 in total. Below there is a table to illustrate this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
